Hospital Management System is a console-based Java application developed using Java, MySQL, and JDBC to manage essential hospital operations through a simple text-based interface. 
The system allows users to efficiently handle patient records, doctor details, appointment scheduling, and  CRUD operations directly from the console. 
MySQL serves as the backend database for storing all hospital data securely, while JDBC enables smooth communication between the Java program and the database. 
This project simplifies hospital administration by reducing manual work, improving data accuracy, and offering an easy-to-use console workflow for managing daily hospital tasks.
